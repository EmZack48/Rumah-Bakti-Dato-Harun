  <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; color: green;">The Term of Orphans in terms of Islamic Sharia</span></p>
  <p>As for according to the term syara', what is meant by an orphan is a child whose father died before he reached puberty. The limit or period for a child to be called an orphan is until the child reaches puberty and becomes an adult. For people who have grown up and then lost their parents are no longer called orphans because they are already able to support and take care of themselves. It is only suitable for children because they are not able to take care and support themselves and still need help and assistance from others.</p>
  <span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; color: black; font-weight: bold;"><br> According to Fath Al-Qarib and Al-Baijuri: </span><span style="font-size: 1pt; font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; color: black;"><br></span>
<p>An orphan means a small child (underage), who does not have a father, whether the child is a boy or a girl, whether he has a grandfather or not. This includes minor children of adultery, children of collection and children who are denied because of divorce between husband and wife. When he reaches puberty, he is not called an orphan, and he reaches puberty when he is fifteen years old.</p>

<p>However, the Malaysian Malay community has another term, Yatim Piatu, which is meant as those who have lost both their mother and father, although this term is not actually in Islamic law. </p>
<p>An orphan is a child of their death&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">father</span> or both when they are small or immature. Islam enjoins mankind to have a good relationship with orphans, provide protection and education and give them their rights.</p>
